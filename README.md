WoW Cata Classic roster creator


The goal of this code is to create a 25 person roster for WoW Cata Classic raid teams. It will track players, their alts available to the raid team, absences, benches, and no shows. It will also track raid buffs and warn the raid leader of missing raid buffs based on the roster selection. It will make suggestions of who to include if there is a missing buff and an available player/alt with the necessary buff.

I suck at coding, so please make it better.
